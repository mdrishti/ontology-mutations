1. MESH terms appear to be not extractable. However, MESH:GeneticFitness of an organism is a useful Class to be included in the ontology. There must be a way in something else from biolink. For the rest, I have downloaded the ontology files.

2. Figure out a way to extract all gold.vocab terms i side the three main biome types. While the current model only offers 'suggestions' to use GOLD biomes, once these biomes are downloaded without full import of GOLD, one can restrict the the values for the range of object property "mvikg:has_habitat".
